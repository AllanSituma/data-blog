<h2 class="section-heading">What is ELT?</h2>

<p>ELT stand for 'extract, transform, load'.It is the process a data pipeline uses to get data from a source system e.g. database, loads it into a target system and also performs some transformation on the data. There are tools that can handle the entire ELT process while some just handle one part of the process</p>

<p>This article will focus on tools that enable transformation i.e. the 'T' in the ELT process. We will cover basic introductions but in future provide practical examples</p>

<h1>Open Source Data Transformation Tools</h1>
<p>Open source data transformation tools are valuable for processing, cleaning, and transforming data to make it suitable for analysis. Here are some popular open source tools used for these purposes:</p>

<h2>1. Apache NiFi</h2>
