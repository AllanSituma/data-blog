<h2 class="section-heading">What is ELT?</h2>

<p>ELT stand for 'extract, transform, load'.It is the process a data pipeline uses to get data from a source system e.g. database, loads it into a target system and also performs some transformation on the data. There are tools that can handle the entire ELT process while some just handle one part of the process</p>

<p>This article will focus on tools that enable transformation i.e. the 'T' in the ELT process. We will cover basic introductions but in future provide practical examples</p>
