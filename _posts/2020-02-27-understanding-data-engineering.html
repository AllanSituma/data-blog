<blockquote class="blockquote">Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems.
- Scott Adams </blockquote>

<p>Data science as a professional is currently getting much of the hype in the data world.However not much is being said about the enablers of data science, i.e. data engineers. In the real world, there is need for professionals who find data from different data sources, store, clean and aggregate this data ready for use by data scientist and othere end users</p>

<p>In this articles, we will talk about what data engineering is about and also the tools and frameworks used. We will finally touch on a subset of data engineering i.e. analytics engineering</p>
