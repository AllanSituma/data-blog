<h2 class="section-heading">Data pipelines</h2>
<p>For data driven organizations, one of the most critical operations is the efficient flow of data from source systems to target systems.Useful analysis can only begin once data is availed to it's end users in a formart that is easy to use and is accessible</p>

<p>Moving data from one place to another, especially data of large volumes can be a daunting task. This is because data can be corrupted, data can be coming in slow i.e. hitting latency bottlenecks or data sources/desitinations may conflict</p>

<p>With this problems in mind, there has been need of creating softwares that eliminate the manual steps from the data flow process. This is by automating extraction, loading ,transformation,testing and documentation of data for further analysis. The softwares make up a data pipeline that readies data for the end users</p>

<p> Data pipelines can handle the following types of processing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Streaming processing - this involves processing data almost 			 instantaneously as it streams from source to target destinationg e.g. IOT data</li>
 <li>Batch processing - this is the processing of large volumes of data at 	once over specified intervals of time</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog will be focus on a theoritical introduction on how to set up a simple batch processing data pipeline with SQL. The following blog posts as listed below will focus on a practical example of setting this up using the tools in this blog.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part 2: Setting up dbt(data build tool), Postgresql and gitlab ci</li>
  <li>Part 3: Data modelling, documentation and testing</li>
  <li>Part 4: Version controll and continous integration</li>
  <li>Part 5: Visualization with tableau</li>
</ul>
