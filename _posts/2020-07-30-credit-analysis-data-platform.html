<h1>Building a Robust Credit Scoring Data Platform: A Dive into MySQL, Python, dbt, Power BI, and Docker</h1>

<p>In today's data-driven world, businesses thrive on insights derived from robust data pipelines. Whether it's understanding customer behavior, optimizing operations, or making strategic decisions, having a solid foundation for data analysis is paramount. One such foundation is a credit scoring data platform, which not only aids in risk assessment but also provides invaluable insights into customer behavior and financial trends.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Components</h2>

<p><strong>MySQL:</strong> As the primary data source, our production MySQL database houses a wealth of valuable information. From transactional data to customer demographics, this database serves as the starting point for our data journey.</p>

<p><strong>Python:</strong> Python emerges as the language of choice for writing our Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes. Leveraging its versatility and rich ecosystem of libraries, we craft robust scripts to extract data from the production MySQL database, apply necessary transformations, and load it into our MySQL data warehouse seamlessly.</p>

<p><strong>dbt (data build tool):</strong> Central to our data modeling efforts, dbt empowers us to define, document, and test data transformation pipelines with ease. With dbt, we can build modular, version-controlled models that transform raw data into curated datasets, ready for analysis. Its ability to automate SQL-based transformations streamlines our workflow, ensuring consistency and reliability in our data modeling endeavors.</p>

<p><strong>Power BI:</strong> Visualization is key to unlocking the insights hidden within our data. Power BI serves as our visualization tool of choice, offering a user-friendly interface and powerful analytical capabilities. With its intuitive drag-and-drop features and robust dashboarding capabilities, Power BI enables us to create compelling visualizations that convey complex insights at a glance.</p>

<p><strong>Docker:</strong> Docker simplifies the process of setting up and managing our development and production environments. By containerizing our services, we ensure consistency across different stages of development and deployment, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Docker Services</h2>

<p>To orchestrate our services, we use Docker Compose. Here’s the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file that sets up our MySQL databases, Python scripts, and dbt:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">version: '3.8'

services:
  mysql-production:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: loans_db
    ports:
      - "3307:3306"
    volumes:
      - mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql

  mysql-warehouse:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: loans_warehouse
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - mysql-warehouse-data:/var/lib/mysql

  generate-data:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile_generate_data
    environment:
      MYSQL_PROD_HOST: mysql-production
      MYSQL_PROD_PORT: 3306
      MYSQL_PROD_USER: root
      MYSQL_PROD_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_PROD_DB: loans_db
    depends_on:
      - mysql-production

  etl-script:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile_etl_script
    environment:
      MYSQL_PROD_HOST: mysql-production
      MYSQL_PROD_PORT: 3306
      MYSQL_PROD_USER: root
      MYSQL_PROD_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_PROD_DB: loans_db
      MYSQL_WAREHOUSE_HOST: mysql-warehouse
      MYSQL_WAREHOUSE_PORT: 3306
      MYSQL_WAREHOUSE_USER: root
      MYSQL_WAREHOUSE_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_WAREHOUSE_DB: loans_warehouse
    depends_on:
      - mysql-production
      - mysql-warehouse

  dbt:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile_dbt
    environment:
      DBT_PROFILES_DIR: /usr/app/dbt
    depends_on:
      - mysql-warehouse

volumes:
  mysql-data:
  mysql-warehouse-data:</code></pre>

<h2>Dockerfiles for the Services</h2>

<p><strong>Dockerfile for Data Generation (<code>Dockerfile_generate_data</code>)</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-dockerfile">FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY generate_data.py .

CMD ["python", "./generate_data.py"]</code></pre>

<p><strong>Dockerfile for ETL Script (<code>Dockerfile_etl_script</code>)</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-dockerfile">FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY etl_script.py .

CMD ["python", "./etl_script.py"]</code></pre>

<p><strong>Dockerfile for dbt (<code>Dockerfile_dbt</code>)</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-dockerfile">FROM fishtownanalytics/dbt:latest

WORKDIR /usr/app

COPY dbt/ ./dbt/

CMD ["dbt", "run"]</code></pre>

<h2>Data Extraction with Python</h2>

<p>Once we've set up our Docker services, we can start by extracting data from the production MySQL database using Python scripts. Below is a sample Python script for data extraction:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import mysql.connector

# Establishing connection to the MySQL database
def connect_to_mysql(host, port, user, password, database):
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host=host,
        port=port,
        user=user,
        password=password,
        database=database
    )
    return connection

# Sample data extraction function
def extract_data(connection):
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Your data extraction logic here

    cursor.close()
    connection.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace these values with your MySQL connection details
    host = "mysql-production"
    port = 3306
    user = "root"
    password = "password"
    database = "loans_db"

    connection = connect_to_mysql(host, port, user, password, database)
    extract_data(connection)</code></pre>

<h2>Transforming Data with dbt</h2>

<p>Once extracted, the data undergoes a series of transformations orchestrated through dbt. Leveraging SQL-based transformations, we cleanse, enrich, and model the data to create a unified view of customer information—a golden record that serves as the foundation for our credit scoring endeavors.</p>

<p>To define the transformation pipelines, we create models using dbt. Below is an example of a dbt model for creating a customer dimension table:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">-- models/dim_customer.sql

{{ config(materialized='table') }}

SELECT
    CustomerID,
    Name,
    Address,
    ContactInfo
FROM {{ ref('staging_customers') }};</code></pre>

<h2>Data Visualization with Power BI</h2>

<p>With our curated datasets in place, we leverage Power BI to create insightful visualizations and dashboards. From interactive charts depicting credit utilization trends to predictive models forecasting default probabilities, Power BI empowers us to explore the data from various angles, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions with confidence.</p>
