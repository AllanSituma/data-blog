<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction to Mongodb</h2>

<p>Mongodb arose in the mid-2000s under the NoSQL banner for use in big data processing and applications whose data would not fit well in a conventional database. It is termed as an open source database management system whose architecture is made up of collections and documents i.e. a document oriented database that supports multiple forms of data</p>

<p>Below is a quick recipe to install and get started with Mongodb</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Linux - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS</li>
  <li>Good Internet</li>
  <li>Basic CLI knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>Open your CLI and run the following codes line by line </p>
  <code>
    #Install Mongo<br>
    
	sudo apt-get update<br>
	sudo apt-get install mongodb<br>


	#Set up auth<br>
	nano /etc/mongodb.con<br>

	edit auth=true<br>

	#Create admin user<br>


	// switch to the admin database<br>
	use admin<br>

	// create a new user to be stored in the admin database
	db.createUser({ 
    	user:"admin", 
    	pwd:"xxxxxxxxx", 
    	roles:[
        	{ role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin"  }
    	] 
		})

	// log out of mongo shell
	exit

	#log in as admin

	mongo -u admin --authenticationDatabase admin -p

	#create user etl

	// ensure the new user is created under admin
	use admin

	// create new user and assign Read/Write permission only
    db.createUser({ 
        user:"etl", 
        pwd:"etl",
        roles:[{ role: "readWrite", db: "etl"  }]  
    })

	#test if user was created

	mongo -u etl --authenticationDatabase admin -p
  </code>
